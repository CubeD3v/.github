This is where Cube's free scripts will be made readily available to you.

We believe in communities of all sizes deserve quality regardless of cost.

## What makes Cube differ from the rest?

✅ **Guaranteed Quality:** Regardless of whether a script is free or paid, we maintain our commitment to excellence. Each script is crafted with meticulous attention to detail to ensure a seamless in-game experience.

✅ **Approachable and Active Support:** At Cube Developments, we are committed to providing our loyal supporters the best customer support service.

✅ **Regular Updates:** We are committed to regularly updating and improving our scripts and assets, regardless of how complete they may seem. 

✅ **Community First:** We value our community members' input and welcome their feedback, suggestions, and contributions. We aim to listen to and take into account our members' opinions.

✅ **Reasonable Pricing:** Quality should be the standard, and we try to give all communities a chance to access unique and premium scripts without breaking the bank.

✅ **Customisable & User-friendly:** Our resources are highly configurable, and we provide the flexibility to adjust them to your liking while using FiveM's native escrow system for most scripts.
